**Summary:**

OpenMS's Export CCD module facilitates the exchange of patient summary information in a standardized format. The module allows users to configure sections to group specific concepts from the data model, ensuring consistency when exporting patient data.

**Important Points:**

* CCD data is structured in sections, each containing relevant concepts.
* Concepts can be grouped by concept sets (e.g., Vital Signs) or added individually.
* To ensure universal data mapping, each concept must have a corresponding code system (e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD9).
* Exporting patient data results in an XML file that contains the configured sections and concepts.
* The XML file can be saved locally and shared with authorized parties.
