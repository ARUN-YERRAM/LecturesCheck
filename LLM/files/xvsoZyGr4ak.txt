**Summary:**

In the current market, the easiest way to land a tech job is in the blockchain industry. Cryptocurrency and blockchain services are experiencing increased demand due to the growth of artificial intelligence and the need for trust-minimized services. Despite the hype, large financial institutions are investing in blockchain, signaling its potential for mainstream adoption.

Blockchain companies are aggressively hiring developers and other tech professionals. Unlike traditional tech companies, they are willing to train individuals with limited blockchain experience. Roles include blockchain development, frontend engineering, infrastructure, mobile, product management, and more.

Two remote-first blockchain companies actively hiring are Coinbase and Chainlink Labs. The lack of competition from applicants in the blockchain industry makes it easier to secure interviews and employment, especially for those lacking extensive experience.
