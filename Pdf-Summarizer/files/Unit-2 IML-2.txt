Here is a list of the main points from the PDF content:

1. Measures of Dispersion (Variability):
	* Data variability refers to the spread or dispersion of a set of data.
	* Four main ways to describe variability: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Interquartile Range (IQR).
	* Range: the spread of data from lowest to highest value, calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value.
	* Variance: a measure of how data points differ from the mean, calculated as the average of squared distances from each point to the mean.
	* Standard Deviation: the square root of the variance, used to get original values.
	* Interquartile Range (IQR): a measure of variability that divides a dataset into quartiles.
2. Key Points:
	* Range: large range means high variability, small range means low variability.
	* Variance: small variance indicates data points are close to the mean, high variance indicates data points are spread out from the mean.
	* Standard Deviation: low standard deviation means data are clustered around the mean, high standard deviation means data are more spread out.
	* IQR: used to measure variability and divide a dataset into quartiles.
3. Quartiles:
	* The first, second, and third quartiles are called Q1, Q2, and Q3, which separate the data into 4 equal parts.
	* The 25th percentile is in Q1, the 50th percentile is in Q2, and the 75th percentile is in Q3.
4. Interquartile Range (IQR):
	* Measures the width of the distribution, with most data points contained within this range.
5. Box Plot:
	* A graph that visualizes the five-number summary, including the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum.
	* Box plot components: the box covers the interquartile interval, with the left and right sides being the lower and upper quartiles, and the vertical line being the median.
6. Skewness:
	* Positive skewness (skewed right) occurs when the median is closer to the bottom of the box and the whisker is shorter on the lower end and longer on the upper end.
	* Negative skewness (skewed left) occurs when the median is closer to the top of the box and the whisker is
