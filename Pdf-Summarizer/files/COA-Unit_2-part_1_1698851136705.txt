Here is a list of the main points from the PDF content:

1. The CPU is composed of three major parts: the register set, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and control unit.
2. The CPU performs various functions based on the type of instructions it receives.
3. Computer architecture is defined as the structure and behavior of the computer as seen by the programmer.
4. The CPU has a general register organization with seven registers connected to two buses through multiplexers.
5. The control unit directs the information flow through the registers and ALU by selecting various components in the system.
6. The ALU provides arithmetic and logic operations, and may also include shift operations.
7. Instruction formats typically consist of an operation code field, an address field, and a mode field.
8. Most computers have one of three types of CPU organizations: single accumulator, general register, or stack organization.
9. Three-address instructions can use each address field to specify either a processor register or memory operand.
10. The Cyber 170 computer is an example of a commercial computer that uses three-address instructions.
