Here is a summary of the main points from the PDF content:

**Descriptive Statistics**

* Descriptive statistics describes and summarizes the features of a dataset
* It is not based on any theory of probability
* Charts and graphs are often used to present descriptive statistics
* It helps data analysts understand the data better

**Data**

* A data set is a collection of related information or records
* Data is essential for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Analytics
* Data can be structured or unstructured (raw data)
* Each row of a data set is called a record, and each data set has multiple attributes (features, variables, dimensions, or fields)

**Qualitative Data**

* Qualitative data cannot be measured or counted in numbers
* It is also known as Categorical Data
* Examples: gender, product quality, etc.
* Qualitative data tells about people's perceptions, helping market researchers understand customer tastes and design strategies accordingly
* Qualitative data is classified into two parts:
	+ Nominal Data
	+ Ordinal Data

**Nominal Data**

* Nominal data is used to label variables without any order or quantitative value
* Numerical tasks cannot be performed on nominal data
* Nominal data does not have any meaningful order and is distributed to distinct categories
* Examples: hair color, etc.

**Types of Data**

* Nominal data: cannot be compared or ordered, examples include marital status, nationality, and gender.
* Ordinal data: has a natural ordering, examples include feedback systems, ranks, and grading.
	+ Can be used for observation, but mean cannot be calculated.
	+ Median and quartiles can be identified.
* Quantitative data: relates to the quantity of an object, can be expressed in numerical values, and includes statistical data analysis.
	+ Can be used for statistical manipulation and represented on various graphs and charts.
	+ Examples include height, weight, room temperature, marks, and time.

**Subtypes of Quantitative Data**

* Discrete data: distinct or separate values, subdivision is not possible, examples include total number of students, number of employees, and days in a week.
* Continuous data: can take any value within a range, examples include temperature, speed, and time.
	+ Further classified into two parts: interval data and ratio data.

**Measures of Central Tendency**

* Mean: arithmetic average of a data set
* Median: middle number in
