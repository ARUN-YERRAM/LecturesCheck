•ID Property: Assigns a unique identifier to a single HTML element.
•Class Property: Allows grouping of multiple HTML elements to style 
them collectively. 
•Reusable Classes: Class properties can be reused across different 
elements for consistent styling.
•Specificity and Targeting: Both properties assist in targeting 
specific elements or groups of elements for precise styling.

15 CSS (Id selector)
•Unique Iden*fier: Targets a specific element with a unique ID 
a7ribute.
•Syntax: Uses the hash (#) symbol

used for storingdata values.

20. Syntax Rules
1.Can’tuse keywordsor reserved words
2.Can’tstart with a number
3.Nospecial characters other than $and _
4.=is for assignment
5.;means end of instruction

21. Updating Values
1.Do not need to use letagain.
2.Syntax: variable = variable + 1
3.AssignmentOperator is used =
4.Short Hand Assignment Operators:
+=, -=, *=, /=, ++

22. Myntra Bag Exercise

23. Naming Conventions
camelCase
•Start with a lowercase le.er. Capitalize the first le.er of each 
subsequent word.
•Example: myVariableName
snake_case
•Start with an lowercase le.er. Separate words with underscore
•Example: my_variable_name
Kebab-case
•All lowercase le.ers. Separate words with hyphens. Used for HTML and 
CSS.
•Example: my-variable-name
Keep a Good and Short Name
•Choose names that are descripJve but not too long. It should make it 
easy to understand the variable's purpose.
•Example: age, firstName, isMarried

3.‘true’ is a String not a Boolean

26. Comparison Operators
•Equality
•==Checks value equality.
•===Checks value and type equality.
•Inequality
•!=Checks value inequality.
•!==Checks value and type inequality.
•Relational
•>Greater than.
•<Less than.
•>=Greater than or equal to.
•<=Less than or equal to.
Order of comparison operators is less than arithmeFc operators

27. if-else
1.Syntax: Uses if () {} to check a condition.
2.Whatis if: Executes block if condition is true, skips if false.
3.Whatis else: Executes a block when the if condition is false.

28. Logical Operators
1.Types: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
2.AND (&&): All conditions must be true for the result to be true.
3.OR (||): Only one condition must be true for the result to be true.
4.NOT (!): Invertsthe Boolean value of a condition.
5.Lower Priority than Mathand Comparisonoperators

29. Scope
1.Any variablecreatedinside {}will remain inside {}
2.Variablecan be redefinedinside {}
3.Vardoes notfollow scope
4.Global Scope: Accessible everywherein the code. 
5.Block Scope: Limitedto a block, mainly with letand const. 
6.Declare variables in the narrowestscope possible.

30. Truthy and Falsy Values
1.FalsyValues: 0, null, undefined, false, NaN, "" 
(empty string)
2.Truthy Values: All valuesnotlisted as falsy.
3.Used in conditionalstatements like if.
4.Non-booleanvalues are auto-convertedin 
logical operations.
5.Be explicitin comparisonsto avoid unexpected 
behaviour.

31. If alternates
1.Ternary Operator: condition ? trueValue: falseValue
Quick one-line if-else.
2.Guard Operator: value || defaultValue
Use when a fallbackvalue is needed.
3.Default Operator: value ?? fallbackValue
Use when you want to consider only null and undefined as falsy.
4.Simplifiesconditional logic.
5.Usewisely to maintain readability.

•The click count should also survive browser refresh.

47. What is an Array?
1.An Array is just a listof values.
2.Index: Starts with 0.
3.Arraysare used for storing multiple values in a 
single variable.

48. ArraySyntax & Values
1.Use[]to create a new array, []brackets enclose list of values
2.Arrayscan be saved to a variable. 
3.Accessing Values: Use [] with index. 
4.Syntax Rules:
•Bracketsstart and end the array.
•Values separated by commas. 
•Can span multiple lines.
5.Arrayscan hold any value, including arrays.
6.typeofoperatoron Array Returns Object.

49. ArrayProperties & Methods
1.Array.isArray() checks if a variable is an array.
2.Lengthproperty holds the size of the array.
3.Common Methods:
•push/pop: Add or remove to end. 
•shift/unshift: Add or remove from front.
•splice: Add or remove elements. 
•toString: Convert to string.
•sort: Sort elements. 
•valueOf: Get array itself.
4.Arrays also use reference like objects.
5.De-structuring also works for Arrays.

50. What is aLoop?
1.Codethat runs multiple timesbased on 
a condition.
2.Loopsalso alterthe flow of execution, 
similar to functions.
•Functions: Reusableblocks of code.
•Loops: Repeated execution of code.
3.Loopsautomate repetitivetasks.
4.Types of Loops: for, while, do-while.
5.Iterations:Number of timesthe loop 
runs.

51. WhileLoop
1.Iterations:Number of timesthe loop runs.
2.Usedfor non-standardconditions.
3.Repeatinga block of code whilea condition is true.
4.Remember: Always include an update to avoid infinite loops.

52.DoWhileLoop
1.Executesblock first, then checks condition.
2.Guaranteedto run at least one iteration.
3.Unlike while, first iteration is unconditional.
4.Don't forget to update condition to avoid infinite loops.

53.ForLoop
1.Standardloop for running code multiple times.
2.Generallypreferred for countingiterations.

54.AccumulatorPattern
1.A pattern to accumulate values through looping.
2.Common Scenarios:
•Sum all the numbers in an array.
•Create a modified copy of an array.

55.Break &Continue
1.Breaklets you stop a loopearly, or break out of a loop
2.Continueis used to skip one iteration or the current 
iteration
3.In while loop remember to do the increment manually 
before using continue

PracticeExercise
Arrays & Loops
1.Create an array of numbers [5,6]. Add 4 at the beginning and 
7 at the end of the array.
2.Create a method to return an element at a particular position 
in the array.
3.Create an array copy using slice method.
4.Createa whileloop that exits after counting 5 prime 
numbers.
5.Modifythe above loop to finish using break.
6.Create a for loop that prints number 1 to 10 in reverse order.
7.Using continue only print positive numbers from the given 
array [1,-6,5,7,-98]
8.Using accumulator pattern concatenate all the strings in the 
given array [‘KG’, ‘Coding’, ‘Javascript’, ‘Course’, ‘is’, ‘Best’]

Advance Functions
56.AnonymousFunctions As Values
57.Arrow functions
58.setTimeout & setInterval
59.Event Listener
60.For Each Loop
61.Array methods

56. AnonymousFunctions As Values
1.Functionsin JavaScript are first-class citizens; they can be 
assigned to variables.
2.Functionsdefined without a name, often assigned to a variable.
3.Anonymous functions can be propertiesin objects
4.Can be passed as arguments to other functions.
5.Invokedusing ()after the function nameor variable.
6.console.log(myFunction); and typeofmyFunctionwill both 
indicate it's a function.

57. ArrowFunctions
1.A concise way to write anonymousfunctions.
2.For Single Argument:Round brackets optional.
3.For Single Line: Curly brackets and return optional.
4.Often used when passing functions as arguments.

58. setTimeout&setInterval
1.Functionsfor executing code asynchronouslyafter a 
delay.
2.setTimeoutruns once; setIntervalruns repeatedly
3.setTimeout:
•Syntax: setTimeout(function, time)
•Cancel: clearTimeout(timerID)
4.setInterval:
•Syntax: setInterval(function, time)
•Cancel: clearInterval(intervalID)

59. EventListener
1.What Is an Event: Occurrences like clicks, mouse 
movement, keyboard input(e.g., birthday, functions).
2.UsingquerySelectorto attach listeners.
3.Multiple Listeners: You can add more than one.
4.removeEventListener('event', functionVariable);

60. For EachLoop
1.A method for array iteration, often preferred for 
readability.
2.Parameters: One for item, optional second for index.
3.Usingreturn is similar to continue in traditional loops.
4.Not straightforward to breakout of a forEachloop.
5.Whenyou need to perform an action on each array 
element and don't need to break early.

61. ArrayMethods
1.Filter Method:
•Syntax: array.filter((value, index) => return true/false)
•Use: Filterselements based on condition.
2.Map Method:
•Syntax: array.map((value) => return newValue)
•Use: Transformseach element.

PracticeExercise
Advance Functions
1.Create a variable multiply and assign a function to this 
variable that multiplies two numbers. Call this method from 
the variable.
2.Create a function runTwice that takes a function as a 
parameter and then runs that method twice.
3.Create a button which should grow double in size on 
clicking after 2 seconds. 
4.In the above exercise add the behavior using an event 
listener instead of onclick.
5.Create a function that sums an array of numbers. Do this 
using a for-each loop.
6.Create a function that takes an array of numbers and 
return their squares using map function.
